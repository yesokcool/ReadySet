# Ready, SET!

An educational project and game based on the card-based "Set" that supports as many traits and trait types as desired (cool!) and enhances the original game by actually making it fun (ouch!).

## Features:
- The full game of Set
- Support for adding as many "traits" as desired (traits can be visualized as anything, like Shapes, Shadings, Numbers, Colors, and so on)
- Support for adding as many "trait types" as desired (types are just integer values and can be visualized as anything, like a Shape trait having the types of Triangle, Circle, Squiggle, Diamond, and so on)
- Score modifier that rewards the player for faster matching
- Two-player mode
    - Compete for a high score!
    - Build up or take down the score modifier together!
    - Time your flags to steal points from your opponent!
        - Or pretend to be civilized and create your own rules!
- Fun animations
- Auto-solving (cheat) mode
- Color-blind accessibility
- Randomized flavor text
- Dark mode!
